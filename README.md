🌿 Plant Disease Prediction using CNN

An end-to-end Deep Learning project to detect plant leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
This system allows users to upload a plant leaf image and get the predicted disease using a trained AI model.

📌 Project Overview

This project uses the PlantVillage Dataset from Kaggle to train a CNN model that can classify plant leaf images into 38 different disease and healthy categories.
The trained model is deployed using Streamlit for real-time prediction.
